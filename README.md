CS4111 - Intro to Databases - Project Part 3

We are establishing a website with google cloud service. The webpage is designed for registered users to explore their likes and comments on music items including musicians, artists, albums and songs. Users are also able to search for their liked songs, albums, artists as well.

Around ten pages are showed in the template folder. They are designed to accomplish registration, login, search, homepage etc. Check it out!

Although no bootstrap UI is introduced currently. We do designed the interface just for fun.
